This is my portfolio web page. Use xampp server to load this web page. Download all the files and go to xampp folder. There is folder called htdocs. Create new folder as portfolio and put all the files inside that folder. 
There are 3 html files as index.html, login.html and register.html.
You can see my portfolio web page by localhost/portfolio/index.html.
PHP part doesn't work well. There is a error in register.php as Undefined array key. I tried to find what happened. But I couldn't. username & password defined correctly as my knowledge. 
Front end works well. There are some errors in backend.
